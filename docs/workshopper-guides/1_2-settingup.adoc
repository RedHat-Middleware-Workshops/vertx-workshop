== Setting up for the lab
Before we start the lab, its important that you read the following instructions carefully. These instructions will be refered from the rest of the content if you need to come back to them.

The lab environment is setup with a customized vert.x stack created for Eclipse Che or CodeReady

== Creating your workspace
Ensure you are logged into to Che/CodeReady with your userXX.
Once logged in, you should see your dashboard. This is your own dashboard and now shared with other users. 
Following instructions will guide you in creating a workspace for this lab. 

Create a workspace by pressing the "Add Workspace" button.

You should now see a new workspace page, lets configure it for our lab. 

=== Step 1: Name your workspace. 
In my case I just add my initials before it. You can choose anything or leave it as is.

=== Step 2: Choose your Stack
Whats a Stack you ask?
A stack is a runtime configuration for a workspace. It contains a runtime recipe, meta information like tags, description, environment name, and security policies. Stacks are displayed within the user dashboard and stack tags are used to filter the project code samples that are available. A stack's recipe can be Kubernetes YAML, a Dockerfile or a Docker Compose file that will create a runtime to be embedded into the workspace. You can use any of Che's 30+ built-in stacks or author your own unique stack for your work.

Choosing our stack for the lab; select the Vert.x Stack as shown in the image below.

=== Step 3: Import the lab project from github
As showin in the image below, select GIT and add the repo for this lab

Press the add button, and wait for the following dialog to appear. 
Now open the workspace and let it load. It can take some time. Time for any questions?

== Working with Che/CodeReady
If you are familiar with IDE (Integrated Development Environments), Che/CodeReady is no exception. It runs in your browser and has similar experince to running any IDE. 

A few things that are specific to this lab. 

We have created a pre-set of runners for you. to be able to run and compile the exercises. All of them can be executed by clickig the small play icon on the top bar in the Che/CodeReady. 
Following image shows an example.

Once you run your code , in many cases you want to be able to access localhost:8080 since your program might be listenting to it. In case of Che/CodeReady, it will detect that and create a route for you, since you are running this on Openshift. So everytime you run your program, make sure you click the preview link provided by Che/CodeReady.
To make it easy following is a screen shot which also shows the link with the heading "preview:"
