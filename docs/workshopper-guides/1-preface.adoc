== Preface - what happens when you mix reactive, containers and Cloud altogether...

Let's start from the beginning.... _Vert.x_. What's Vert.x? That's a pretty good question, and probably a good start.
 If you go on the http://vertx.io[Vert.x web site], Vert.x is defined as _"a toolkit for building reactive
 applications on the JVM"_. This description is rather unclear, right? What's a _toolkit_? What are _reactive_
 applications? In this lab, we are going to explain these words, and build an application using Vert.x illustrating
 what Vert.x is. This application is going to be composed of _microservices_. Another buzzword that is currently trending, right ? Actually,
 Vert.x was already promoting _microservices_  before anyone else.

The developed application is going to be:

* based on Vert.x (that's why you are here, right?)
* distributed
* built as a reactive system
* (a bit) fun

This lab offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Vert.x, from the first line of code, to making
services, to consuming them and finally to assembling everything in a consistent reactive system. It illustrates what reactive systems are, what reactive programming is, and how to build applications based on reactive microservice**s**
(and the **s** is important).

Deploying and maintaining microservices is hard. Much harder than maintaining a monolith. The are many moving pieces
that can change / evolve / crash at anytime. To help us deploying our microservices, we are going to use Kubernetes.
Kubernetes (commonly referred to as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of
 containerized applications that was originally designed by Google and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
  It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across
  clusters of hosts". In this lab, we are using a specific distribution of K8S named OpenShift that provide a few set
   of features very useful to maintain our microservices. It's **NOT** required to deploy Vert.x applications on top
   of Kubernetes. Bare metal is generally fine. We use Kubernetes in this lab because of the complexity involved when
    dealing with multiple microservices, their updates, downtimes and so on.

This is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop. You need JDK 8+ on your
machine, and Apache Maven (3.5+). On Windows, you will need Cygwin. The lab contain a section to install _minishift_,
 a version of Kubernetes running your laptop.

What you are going to learn:

* What Vert.x is and how to use its asynchronous non-blocking development model
* How to develop microservices with Vert.x with several types of services, and service discovery
* How to deploy microservices on Kubernetes, and how Vert.x interacts with Kubernetes
* What `verticles` are and how to use them 
* How to use the Vert.x event bus to send and receive messages
* How to expose HTTP endpoints with Vert.x, and also how to consume them
* How to compose asynchronous actions
* How to use several languages in the same application
* How to use databases with Vert.x
* How to manage failures with async results, futures, exception handlers and circuit breakers
* How to use Vert.x with RxJava
* How to scale microservices, and use Kubernetes resilience

And many more...

This lab is an _Ã  la carte_ lab. Once you have done the basic installation and introduction, you can pick one of the
topics you are interested in. For instance, after the introduction, if you are interested in gRPC, you can jump to the
 gRPC section and try it out. We highly recommend to start at the beginning to understand the concepts behind Vert.x,
  reactive systems, reactive programming, and microservices.

 Don't expect to complete this lab in 3 hours, it will take you a lot more. But that's not a big deal. Pick the topic
  you want, learn what you want, and come back later to learn more.
