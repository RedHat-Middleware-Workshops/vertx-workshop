== Prerequisites

We will get to the good stuff, coding all the way soon... But before we start, kindly ensure that you have a machine with the minimum requirements.

We have setup a Che/CodeReady environment for you. So all you need is a good browser to go through the labs.
But we dont restrict you, feel free to work with your own IDE on your machine. Just remmember that the labs docs are written for Che. 

Move to the next section on how to setup your Che/CodeReady workspace.

== Optional: Setting up my own machine for the lab
The labs are designed to run entirely on openshift, there is no mandatory requirement to install the following components. The following instructions are means for guidance for anyone who wants to try them out on their own machine. 

*Recommended path is to use the Openshift environment provided in this workshop.

=== Minishift and Openshift Client

Minishift provides a way to run Openshift (and so Kubernetes) on your laptop.

1. Download minishift from https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases
2. Follow the instructions from https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html to install
 it.

Be aware of the prerequisites in terms of hypervisors.

At the end of the installation process, you should have the `minishift` executable in your `$PATH`. Then, follow the
instructions from https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/quickstart.html to start minishift and
access the OpenShift Client (command-line) and console (browser).


=== Java Development Kit

We need a JDK 8+ installed on our machine. Latest JDK can downloaded from:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK 8]
* http://openjdk.java.net/install/[OpenJDK]

You can use either Oracle JDK or OpenJDK.

=== Apache Maven

You need Apache Maven 3.5+. If you don't have it already:

* Download Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
* Unzip to a directory of your choice and add it to the `PATH`.


=== IDE

We recommend you use an IDE. You can use Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code or Netbeans.

==== No IDE ?

If you don't have an IDE, here are the steps to get started with Eclipse.

1. First download Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/oxygen1[the download page].
2. In the _Download Links_ section, be sure to select the right version for your operating system. Once selected it brings you to a download page with a
`Download` button.
3. Once downloaded, unzip it.
4. In the destination directory, you should find an `Eclipse` binary that you can execute.
5. Eclipse asks you to create a workspace.
6. Once launched, click on the _Workbench_ arrow (top right corner).

=== Getting the code

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/vertx-kubernetes-workshop.git
----

You can import the code in your IDE as a Maven project. You can refer to your IDE documentation to know how to import Maven projects.

For Eclipse:

1. Click on `File - Import ... - Maven - Existing Maven Projects`
2. Select the location where you cloned the sources
3. Click _Finish_ and wait...

You are going to see a couple of compilation errors. This is because Eclipse does not mark the `src/main/generated`
directories as _source root_ by default. Right-click on `portfolio-service/src/main/generated` and select _Build Path
-> Use as Source Folder_.
