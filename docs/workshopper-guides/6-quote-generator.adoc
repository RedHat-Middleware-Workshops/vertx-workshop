== The first microservice - the quote generator

Disclaimer, the quote generator is unrealistic, and is basically a set of randoms...

In this chapter, we are going to see:

* how projects are structured, built, and deployed
* how to use the event bus to receive messages
* how to implement HTTP actions
* how to use RX Java 2 to avoid callbacks
* using config maps to configure the application


This chapter is the introduction of the lab. We recommend that you do it so you have a better understanding of the
structured exchanges between the different microservices.

=== Project structure

Let's have a look at the project, as every other project are structured the same way.

Let's start with the `pom.xml` file. This file specifies the Maven build:

1. Define the dependencies
2. Compile the java code and process resources (if any)
3. Build a _fat-jar_

A _fat-jar_ (also called _uber_ jar or _shaded_ jar) is a convenient way to package a Vert.x application. It creates an
_uber-jar_ containing your application and all its dependencies, including Vert.x. Then, to launch it, you just need
to use `java -jar <jar name>` without having to handle the `CLASSPATH`. Wait, I told you that Vert.x does not dictate a
type of packaging. It's true, fat jars are convenient, but they are not the only way. You can use plain (not fat) jars,
OSGi bundles...

The `pom.xml` file also contains a set of properties used to configure the application:

* `vertx.verticle` defines the main verticle - the entry point
* `vertx.cluster.name` defines the name of the cluster

=== Verticle

As you may have noticed, the code is structured in 3 `verticles`, but what are these? Verticles are a way to structure
 Vert.x application code. It's not mandatory, but it is quite convenient. A verticle is a chunk of code that is
 deployed on top of a Vert.x instance. A verticle has access to the instance of `vertx` on which it's deployed and
 can deploy other verticles.

Let's open the `GeneratorConfigVerticle` class, and look at the `start` method:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void start(Future<Void> future) {
    discovery = ServiceDiscovery.create(vertx);
    ConfigRetriever retriever = ConfigRetriever.create(vertx, getConfigurationOptions());

    retriever.rxGetConfig()
        // Read the configuration, and deploy a MarketDataVerticle for each company listed in the configuration.
        .flatMap(config ->
            Observable.fromIterable(config.getJsonArray("companies"))
                .cast(JsonObject.class)
                // Deploy the verticle with a configuration.
                .flatMapSingle(company -> vertx.rxDeployVerticle(MarketDataVerticle.class.getName(),
                    new DeploymentOptions().setConfig(company)))
                .toList()
        )
        // Deploy another verticle
        .flatMap(l -> vertx.rxDeployVerticle(RestQuoteAPIVerticle.class.getName()))
        // Expose the market-data message source
        .flatMap(x -> discovery.rxPublish(MessageSource.createRecord("market-data", ADDRESS)))
        .subscribe((rec, err) -> {
            if (rec != null) {
                this.record = rec;
                future.complete();
            } else {
                future.fail(err);
            }
        });
}
----

This method retrieves the configuration, instantiates the verticles (5 verticles are deployed), and publishes the
services in the service discovery.

First, notice the method signature. It receives a `Future` object indicating that the start is asynchronous. Indeed,
all the actions made in this method are asynchronous. So, when the caller thread reaches the end of the method, the
actions may have not completed. We use this given `Future` to indicate when the process has completed (or failed).

The `start` method:

1. retrieves the configuration (giving the "fake" company settings)
2. deploys one verticle per defined company
3. deploys the `RestQuoteAPIVerticle`
4. exposes the `market-data` message source
5. notifies the given `Future` of the successful completion or failure

To retrieve the configuration the verticle needs a `ConfigRetriever`. This object allows retrieving configuration
chunks from different stores (such as git, files, http, etc.). Here we just load the contents of the `config.json` file
located in the `src/main/resources` directory. The configuration is a `JsonObject`. Vert.x uses JSON heavily, so you are
 going to see a lot of JSON in this lab.

Once we have the retriever, we can retrieve the configuration. This is an asynchronous method (`rxGetConfig`)
returning a `Single` (a stream containing one item). After the configuration is retrieved, we extract the `companies`
array from it and deploy one verticle per defined `company`. The deployment is also asynchronous and done with
`rxDeployVerticle`. These _company_ verticles simulate the value of the stocks. The quotes are sent on the event bus
on the `market` address.

When the _company_ verticles are deployed, we deploy another verticle providing an HTTP API to access market data.
The last part of the method is about the service discovery mentioned in the microservice section. This component
generates quotes sent on the event bus. But to let other components discover where the messages are sent (_where_
means on which address), it registers it. `market-data` is the name of the service, `ADDRESS` (a static final variable defined as `market`) is the event bus
address on which the messages are sent.

Finally, when everything is done, we report the status on the given `Future` object.


Remember, Vert.x is promoting an asynchronous, non-blocking development model. Retrieving the configuration,
deploying verticles, publishing a service may take time, as we cannot block the event loop, these methods are asynchronous.
This code uses RX Java 2 and asynchronous methods are prefixed with `rx`. Upon completion the method returns a `Single` emitting the result
or a failure.

The failure management can be made at any stage, but generally, it's done in the `subscribe` method:

[source, java]
----
 object.rxAsync(param1, param2)
 // ....
 .subscribe((rec, err) -> {
     if (rec != null) {
         future.complete();
     } else {
         future.fail(err);
     }
 });
----

If you remember the architecture, the quote generator also provides an HTTP endpoint returning the last values of the
quotes (but, you are going to work on it). Note that this service is not explicitly published in the service discovery.
That's because Kubernetes is taking care of this part. The Vert.x service discovery interacts with Kubernetes
_services_, so all Kubernetes services can be retrieved by Vert.x.

=== The quote REST endpoint

It's time for you to develop some parts of the application (I know you have pins and needles in your fingers). Open the
`RestQuoteAPIVerticle` file. It's a verticle class extending `AbstractVerticle`. In the `start` method you need to:

1. Receive the event bus _market_ messages to collect the last quotations (in the `quotes` map)
2. Handle HTTP requests to return the list of quotes or a single quote if the `name` (query) param is set.

In this example we are using streams (`Flowable`). Streams are an important part of reactive programming and
architecture. So, it's important to understand how they work and how we manipulate them.

Let's do that....

==== Task - Implementing a Handler to receive events

The first action is about observing the stream of _market_ messages. This is done using
`vertx.eventBus().<JsonObject>consumer(GeneratorConfigVerticle.ADDRESS).toFlowable()`. We now have the stream of
messages, but we need to extract the JSON body and populate the `quotes` map. Implement the missing logic that extracts the
 body of the message (with the `body()` method), and then puts `name -> quote` in the `quotes` map.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
    // TODO Extract the body of the message using `.map(msg -> {})`
    // ----
    .map(Message::body)    // 1
    // ----
    // TODO For each message, populate the `quotes` map with the received quote. Use `.doOnNext(json -> {})`
    // Quotes are json objects you can retrieve from the message body
    // The map is structured as follows: name -> quote
    // ----
    .doOnNext(json -> {
        quotes.put(json.getString("name"), json); // 2
    })
----

First, it retrieves the message body (1) and then stores it in the `quotes` map (2). Note that it's a JSON object.
****

==== Task - Implementing a Handler to handle HTTP requests

Now that you have the `quotes`, let's use them to handle HTTP requests. The code already creates the HTTP server and
provides the stream of HTTP requests. The stream emits an item for every HTTP request received by the server. So, you
 need to handle the request and write the response.

Write the content of the request handler to respond to the request:

1. a response with the `content-type` header set to `application/json` (already done)
2. retrieve the `name` parameter (it's the company name)
3. if the company name is not set, return all the quotes as json.
4. if the company name is set, return the stored quote or a 404 response if the company is unknown

TIP: The response to a request is accessible using `request.response()`

TIP: To write the response use `response.end(content)`.

TIP: To create the JSON representation of an object, you can use the `Json.encode` method

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
server.requestStream().toFlowable()
    .doOnNext(request -> {
        HttpServerResponse response = request.response()           // <1>
            .putHeader("content-type", "application/json");

        // TODO Handle the HTTP request
        // The request handler returns a specific quote if the `name` parameter is set, or the whole map if none.
        // To write the response use: `response.end(content)`
        // If the name is set but not found, you should return 404 (use response.setStatusCode(404)).
        // To encode a Json object, use the `encorePrettily` method
        // ----

        String company = request.getParam("name");                 // <2>
        if (company == null) {
            String content = Json.encodePrettily(quotes);          // <3>
            response.end(content);                                 // <4>
        } else {
            JsonObject quote = quotes.get(company);
            if (quote == null) {
                response.setStatusCode(404).end();                 // <5>
            } else {
                response.end(quote.encodePrettily());
            }
        }
        // ----
    })
.subscribe();                                                      // <6>
----
<1> Get the `response` object from the `request`
<2> Gets the `name` parameter (query parameter)
<3> Encode the map to JSON
<4> Write the response and flush it using `end(...)`
<5> If the given name does not match a company, set the status code to `404`
<6> Notice the `subscribe` here. Without it, we would not get the requests
****

You may wonder why synchronization is not required. Indeed we write in the map and read from it without any
synchronization constructs. Here is one of the main features of Vert.x: all this code is going to be executed by
the **same** event loop, so it's always accessed by the **same** thread, never concurrently.

TIP: The `Map<String, JsonObject>` could be replaced by a simple `JsonObject` as they behave as a `Map<String, Object>`.

=== Creating a config map

A config map is a Kubernetes entity storing the configuration of an application. The application configuration is in
`src/kubernetes/config.json`. We are going to create a _config map_ from this file. In a terminal, execute:

[source, bash]
----
cd quote-generator
oc create configmap app-config --from-file=src/kubernetes/config.json
----

To check that the config map has been created correctly, execute:

[source, bash]
----
oc get configmap -o yaml
----

It should display the Kubernetes entity and in the `data` entry our json content.

Now that the config map is created, let's read it from our application. There are several ways to consume a config
map:

* ENV variables
* Config mounted as a file
* Vert.x Config

We are going to use the second approach and mount the configuration as a file in the application container. Indeed,
our application has been configured to read its configuration from a `config/config.json` file:

[source,java]
----
private ConfigRetrieverOptions getConfigurationOptions() {
    JsonObject path = new JsonObject().put("path", "config/config.json");
    return new ConfigRetrieverOptions().addStore(new ConfigStoreOptions().setType("file").setConfig(path));
}
----

Fortunately, our `deployment.yaml` located in `src/main/fabric8` contains the right configuration to:

1. define a _volume_ with the config map content
2. mount this volume in the right directory

You can also see that this file contains the JAVA options we pass to the process.

=== Time to start the quote generator

Show time! Let's build and deploy the microservice _fat-jar_. In the terminal, execute:

----
cd quote-generator
mvn fabric8:deploy
----

TIP: You can deploy the completed version using `mvn fabric8:deploy -Psolution`.

Once deployed, go to the OpenShift Web Console and click on the route url:

image:quote-openshift.png[Deployment of the quote generator in OpenShift, 800]

You should see:

----
{
  "MacroHard" : {
    "volume" : 100000,
    "shares" : 51351,
    "symbol" : "MCH",
    "name" : "MacroHard",
    "ask" : 655.0,
    "bid" : 666.0,
    "open" : 600.0
  },
  "Black Coat" : {
    "volume" : 90000,
    "shares" : 45889,
    "symbol" : "BCT",
    "name" : "Black Coat",
    "ask" : 654.0,
    "bid" : 641.0,
    "open" : 300.0
  },
  "Divinator" : {
    "volume" : 500000,
    "shares" : 251415,
    "symbol" : "DVN",
    "name" : "Divinator",
    "ask" : 877.0,
    "bid" : 868.0,
    "open" : 800.0
  }
}
----

It gives the current details of each quotes. The data is updated every 3 seconds, so refresh your browser to get
the latest data.

=== Task - Deploying the dashboard

We also need to deploy the dashboard. From the `micro-trader-dashboard` directory, execute:

[source, bash]
----
mvn fabric8:deploy
----

In the OpenShift web console, wait until the pod is ready and click on the associated route. Append "/admin" and you
should see the dashboard. If you go into the _trader_ tab, the graph should display the evolution of the market.

=== You are not a financial expert ?

So maybe you are not used to the financial world and words... Neither am I, and this is a overly simplified version.
Let's define the important fields:

* `name` : the company name
* `symbol` : short name
* `shares` : the number of stock that can be bought
* `open` : the stock price when the session opened
* `ask` : the price of the stock when you buy them (seller price)
* `bid` : the price of the stock when you sell them (buyer price)
